# Minecraft projects

A small repository with different ComputerCraft programs, that I write during expert pack playthroughs.

Some odds and ends like pressure control for Pneumatica Repressurized and altar management made it in here while works that are better written are the combustion setup for E2E Skyblock and the generic MultiCrafter I did for FTB Skies Expert.

### Needs setup

The files starting with *run_* are from example setups of the MultiCrafter and the Combustor.

This *will not work* out of the box without adaptation. At least peripheral names will need to be adjusted in the calling scripts.
